On June 12, 2020, Mayor Martin Walsh signed the Obama Foundation’s “My Brother’s Keeper Alliance Pledge.” As part of this pledge, the Mayor 
convened the Boston Police Reform Task Force (“Task Force”), an 11-member group composed of community leaders, advocates, members of the legal 
profession, and law enforcement officers. The mayor accepted the Task Force recommendations on October 13, 2020. This scorecard shows the 
implementation status of each recommendation set out by the Task Force.  
 
To date, most of the recommendations related to the internal policies of the Boston Police Department (BPD) have been implemented to ensure compliance 
with “An Act Relative to Justice, Equity and Accountability in Law Enforcement in the Commonwealth” (adopted on December 31, 2020). Many of the 
recommendations related to hiring practices, diversity, equity, and inclusion, and training are either “in progress,” or their status could not be determined 
based on the publicly available dat"

commission will be issuing standards on training and police certification that may overlap with the Task Force recommendations.

5 Rule 405 outlines a clear procedure for the public to request footage through the “Video Evidence Unit.” However, the rule does not 
explicitly state that the recorded individual or their next of kin would have “unfettered access” to the recorded footage, as is recommended 
by the Task Force.  
6 Rule 405 lists BWC violations and restrictions but does not appear to have the “progressive tier system” recommended by the Task Force  
7 BPD voluntarily reports “use-of-force” data to the FBI. 
8 BPD’s rules pertaining to the “use of force” appear to mirror elements of the “Use of Force Continuum” recommended by the Task Force.  
9 Rule 303B lists pregnant women, people with physical disabilities, children, and the elderly as “vulnerable subjects,” but does not mention 
race, gender, or sexual orientation as is recommended by the Task Force. As of April 12, 2021, the BPD issued a policy on interacting with 
transgender individuals.

force incidents, and c) search warrants. The Task Force also recommended that the Dashboard be translated to the languages spoken by 
Boston residents. It is currently only available in English. 
11 BPD’s rules have different protocols for the release of records. There is no standardized location where the public is made aware of the 
collective timelines for record releases. Q&A on information release can be located on the BPD News website. The City of Boston also has 
a public record request portal.
