Summer is a season of joy. Longer days, warmer nights, endless opportunities to get 
outside, connect with neighbors, and take in everything our city has to offer.  
 
To make sure we’re all able to enjoy summer to the fullest, our Community Safety Team 
has been collaborating across Departments and working alongside students and 
families, faith leaders, coaches, and advocates to create a summer safety plan tailored 
to meet the unique needs of each of our neighborhoods. 
 
This year’s Plan for a Safe, Healthy and Active Summer relies on what we know to be true 
about safety: It isn’t just the absence of violence and crime, it’s the presence of joy and 
community, opportunity and connection. That's why we're bringing cultural festivals 
and DJ classes, movie nights and puppet shows, and activities and events for residents 
of all ages to every corner of our city this summer. 
 
Last year, thanks to our work together, we made Boston the safest major city in 
America. Th"

impacted by violence to invest in the pathways that divert it—to interrupt the patterns 
that get in the way of repair and prosperity.  
 
But we know there’s more work to do. For Boston to truly be a home for everyone, our 
city must be safe for everyone. Every act of violence is one too many. Our summer 
safety plan is at the heart of our ongoing work to end violence and cultivate community 
for every one of our residents. So I want to thank all of you for sharing your 
experiences, helping us identify and fill gaps, and working with us to create this plan 
together.  
 
With love and gratitude, and wishing you a summer filled with joy,

Mayor of Boston

P003,"2025-The Plan for a Safe, Healthy and Active Summer 2025.pdf",2,418240eb-31aa-4f61-a5a6-a11e805de641,"The Mayor’s Community Safety Team (CST) is charged annually with the preparation and distribution of a plan focused around 
coordinating across City departments and providing resources to prevent, intervene and recover from acts of  community 
violence. Historically, this plan was assembled internally - without community input. Under the Wu Administration, Senior 
Advisor for Community Safety Isaac Yablo has prioritized the importance of building a plan for community, by community.  
 
This strategy to build Boston’s Plan for a Safe, Healthy and Active Summer 2025 encompassed a two-step process:​
 
COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT​
As we did last summer, we hosted neighborhood-based engagements across the city, 11 in total. These 
engagements allowed us to understand the wants and needs of each community as well as identify citywide 
trends that ultimately help us form our goals for each summer. Held in community centers, artist spaces, and 
even in different languages - these meetings are crucial"
P003,"2025-The Plan for a Safe, Healthy and Active Summer 2025.pdf",2,838696b9-66ee-49e0-8cf7-820bf3dd50a5," not only to forming our policy as a city, but they serve as 
a segue between our office and the communities we serve, meeting in a common space to find common ground 
on issues that impact everyone.  ​
​
COMMUNITY EMPOWERMENT 
Building off of last summer’s engagements, we pivoted this spring - exchanging 30 meetings last year for 10 
meetings supplemented by our first ever Village Vibes. These Village Vibes were engagements focused on 
empowering the community - bringing the neighborhood together with food, music, games and summer 
resources long before the summer begins. Of the 9 Village Vibes we hosted, nearly 150 neighborhood-based 
organizations, city departments, state agencies and youth organizations joined together to give away resources to 
community members - free of charge.  
 
The Community Safety Team hosted 10 neighborhood-specific meetings and one meeting focused on the city’s LGBTQIA+ 
population. Meetings were held in BCYF Community Centers, ensuring that all community"
P003,"2025-The Plan for a Safe, Healthy and Active Summer 2025.pdf",2,128a7dd7-1324-4c61-b5fd-5f1ab8778607," members had safe and 
accessible options to meet with the Community Safety team. While each neighborhood had their own specific issues they 
would like to see addressed, we identified these citywide trends as our goals for Summer 2025: 
​
ENHANCED STREET SAFETY​
Throughout the City, we learned that safer and slower streets are vital not only to keeping pedestrians safe - but that 
some intersections are hotspots for violence due to their design, leading to collisions that can escalate into further 
violence. ​
 
ENHANCED PUBLIC SPACE SAFETY:​
Many residents emphasized that they’d like to see increased engagement and enforcement around drug use and vagrancy 
in public parks and community spaces. Residents noted that while not a constant problem, the open use of drugs in 
public can often lead to confrontations that may escalate into further violence.  
​
POSITIVE POLICE PRESENCE 
Residents understand that Police are short staffed, but almost unanimously asked for more dedicated communi"
P003,"2025-The Plan for a Safe, Healthy and Active Summer 2025.pdf",2,728026f3-960d-4208-8dda-51600b6779c1,"ty 
engagement and general visibility from police - even in areas where violence may not be present.                                
 
INCREASED AND INTENTIONAL COMMUNITY COHESION​
Residents across the city made it a point to note that while the City hosts plenty of community events, there’s 
often a disconnect between the greater community versus those who are intentionally engaged and as a result, 
better informed as a result. A sense of community has to be deliberately and intentionally formed - either by the 
city or community members - to unite neighborhoods and neighbors, building accountability and a sense of 
belonging for everyone.​
 
YOUTH ENGAGEMENT AND SPACE ACTIVATION​
The City of Boston regularly funds activities for young people across the city and has begun to engage youth 
around these events - that said, many events don’t appeal to a majority of young people as a result of their 
location, sponsor, or content. By working directly with young people to respond to their "

desires for activation, we can better engage with them across the city.  ​

Boston’s Plan to End Violence was officially endorsed by Mayor Wu in 2024, and since then has been at the 
core of the Community Safety Team’s work - using a holistic approach to address the root causes of violence 
throughout our City. While we prioritize safety measures for summertime in this document, the Plan to End 
Violence is a year-round framework for Boston to come together to end violence in our City.  
 
Throughout our engagement for this Summer Safety Plan, we heard a common refrain: What is the City’s 
long-term approach to addressing violence? How is the City of Boston thinking about addressing root 
causes of violence? Over the past 18 months, the Community Safety team, in partnership with the Boston 
Public Health Commission, has worked towards an answer to these questions, and we are now proud to 
present the City’s first Plan to End Violence.  
 
The Plan to End Violence is a long-term, sustainable, and visionary approach to violence preven"
P003,"2025-The Plan for a Safe, Healthy and Active Summer 2025.pdf",3,a36825a0-4f0c-4205-81d5-7d1b05bb2a0d,"tion 
Boston has consistently led in innovative violence prevention strategies, as evidenced by our strategy in the 
following pages. But our larger vision for Boston is not just one where we just reduce violence through a 
seasonal, band-aid approach – but where we end violence, holistically and year-round. This includes 
avoiding the pitfalls of systemic violence by fundamentally reimagining community engagement’s impact 
on policy and centering the lived experiences of those most impacted by violence.  
 
The Summer Safety Plan will remain a part of this long-term strategy, and the City will continue to ensure 
that whenever violence takes place, we mobilize whatever resources are needed to restore safety for our 
residents. But we believe that any incident of violence is too many, and we are committed to building 
systems that will not just maintain peace or stability, but guarantee safety, health, and joy for all our 
residents.  
 
We used community input as a foundation for the "
P003,"2025-The Plan for a Safe, Healthy and Active Summer 2025.pdf",3,89930bd3-0ff3-4d1d-a336-06d6d76e78aa,"Plan, which contains both ongoing work in the City and 
new investments and proposals that would take our violence prevention strategy to the next level. From 
February to December 2023, we ran a rigorous process with over 500 voices heard, including: 
-​
Qualitative data from ~15 focus groups, across grassroots engagements, with young people, with 
residents in the crescent (Roxbury, Mattapan, Dorchester), East Boston, and impacted 
neighborhoods, and/or with providers; 
-​
An adult survey on forms of violence and level of trust in institutions, public and private; 
-​
A survey for young people, designed by young people and administered primarily by young leaders 
in Start Strong; and 
-​
Notes, testimonies, and evidence from various other forums, working group conversations, listening 
sessions, and other kinds of engagements concerned with violence prevention in Boston.  
 
Below are the core themes we identified as a result of this engagement.

​
Prevention (primary) -  Creating conditions for peace, or what public health professionals call “primary prevention.” ​
​
Intervention (secondary) - Addressing what leads to harm, or “secondary prevention.”​
​
Recovery - Healing after violence, or “tertiary prevention.”​
​
Reinvestment -  Investing in workforce, data, and impacted people & communities at scale.  
Whereas our City has traditionally prioritized “Intervention,” the Plan also details a vision for how the City should be 
involved in generating peace, facilitating healing, and supporting communities in supporting themselves. Here are some 
examples of the expansive ways we’re thinking about violence prevention.

Fire prevention is just as important as fire fighting. Summer is a time for fun, but it is important to make sure

On average, grills cause about 10,600 household fires per year. July is the peak month, followed by June, May, 
and August. As a reminder during Summer Months:​

- Propane and charcoal BBQ grills should only be used outdoors​
- Keep children and pets at least three feet away from the grill​

Problem Properties 
To address crime and blight in our neighborhoods, the City created the Problem Properties Task Force in 2011. 
The Task Force represents a consortium of City departments and agencies. As part of our work, we identify 
“problem properties.” These properties often soak up the City’s public safety and neighborhood resources. In 
some cases, these addresses are centers of drug use, violence, or other crimes. In other cases, they are visual 
blights that pose a safety hazard. In all cases, owners have allowed their properties to become chronic 
problems. Through our enforcement authority, the Task Force holds property owners responsible. We 
empower the City to levy fines against absentee landlords. We also give citizens a way to address quality of life 
issues. For more information on the task force, how to designate a property, or to view the “problem

significant challenges. While Summer 2023 saw the lowest shooting victim total since 2005 (58), and lowest 
incident total since 2009 (42), the City remains committed to reducing firearm violence as one victim is one

hospitals. The Team meets on a weekly basis to discuss updates related to Boston’s CVI strategy, discuss 
current and emerging trends in Boston surrounding violence.  
 
Boston’s Summer strategy to reduce community violence is comprised of a 
management team that works to execute 4 Key Strategies:​
​
Engage “high-risk” individuals with high-quality services and supports​
Rigorous research indicates that individuals at the highest risk for violence, at any age, can benefit 
significantly from high quality behavioral health supports. Building on city efforts already underway, the city 
performed a needs analysis to confirm how many individuals are at the highest risk for violence and to assess 
their needs. Based on that analysis, the mayor’s office has developed a plan for expanding services to offer 
100% of those at the highest risk for violence the help they need. The city will soon work to develop an 
integrated citywide database to track services and ensure accountab"

expand support for hospital-based intervention programs to ensure services and support are available 
citywide when individuals are admitted to emergency rooms for violent penetrating injuries. 
 
Weekly and Bi-Weekly Incident Review Meetings​
Proactively responding in a coordinated manner to recent incidents of violence is a hallmark of many 
evidence-informed approaches to reducing violence. Beginning in June, the Boston Police Department and 
Boston Public Health Commission will convene weekly and bi-weekly meetings respectively to bring together 
law enforcement, public health, and violence intervention workers to ensure coordinated responses to recent 
conflicts that have or may become violent.​

reductions in violent crime when done correctly. According to the Boston Regional Intelligence Center, there

Within the aforementioned areas where violence concentrates, the Mayor’s office will pilot regular 
placed-based partnership meetings between law enforcement, other city services, and community 
stakeholders in several impacted areas where violence concentrates. The goal of the meetings is to increase
