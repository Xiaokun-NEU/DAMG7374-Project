366
however, that if the commission revised the proposed value pursuant to subsection (f) of section 
367
24, the upper payment limit shall be the drug’s revised proposed value. The commission may set 
368
an upper payment limit that is different than the proposed value for good cause; provided, 
369
however, that the commission shall adopt regulations defining good cause prior to setting any

sale or distribution of the drug. The commission shall assess a penalty not more than 1 year’s

897
probate court for the county in which the birth of the adopted person occurred or in accordance

following meanings unless the context clearly requires otherwise:

“Benefits”, (i) Supplemental Security Income benefits under Title XVI of the Social 
1147
Security Act; (ii) Retirement, Survivors or Disability Insurance benefits under Title II of the 
1148
Social Security Act; and (iii) other federal benefits.

(b) Not more than 60 days after a child is committed to the custody of the department 
1152
including, but not limited to, placement in foster care under a voluntary placement agreement or 
1153
court-ordered custody arrangement, the department shall make all reasonable efforts to identify 
1154
whether the child is receiving or may be eligible to receive benefits. In reviewing eligibility, the 
1155
department shall consult with the parents and other individuals who may have information about 
1156
the child’s eligibility. If the department determines, "
P004,S2525.pdf,349,0af37cee-bdb3-4a35-9fb5-02bebb7fb53e,"or has cause to believe, that the child may be 
1157
eligible for benefits, it shall apply for benefits on the child’s behalf. If the agency administering 
1158
such benefits denies the application, the department may appeal the decision as permitted by the 
1159
agency administering the benefits. The department shall review cases of children in foster care 
1160
annually to determine whether the child may have become eligible for benefits after the initial 
1161
assessment determined them to be ineligible or whether the child may be eligible for new 
1162
benefits after the initial assessment. The department shall seek federal foster care reimbursement 
1163
for a child only if such reimbursement will not impact the child’s eligibility for benefits or the 
1164
dollar amount of benefits.

1168
department is applying for benefits for the child. The department shall consider whether applying 
1169
to become the child’s representative payee or fiduciary under this section will undermine the 
1170
goal of reunification and not be in the child’s best interests.
